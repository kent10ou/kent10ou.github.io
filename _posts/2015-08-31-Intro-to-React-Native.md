title: Intro to React Native
---

<p>React Native is currently the new hotness right now for developing apps for mobile. It allows you to build native iOS and Android apps in Javascript and React. You can think of React as taking charge of the Views controller. There is no data binding and no event management. When the data changes, React will automatically change what the view should look. To get started, simply use Homebrew to install Node and watchman. 

{% highlight javascript %}
brew install node

brew install watchman
{% endhighlight %}
