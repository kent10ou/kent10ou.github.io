title: Practicing Algorithms
---

When I first started practicing Javascript at the beginning of this year, I had this huge misconception about algorithms. Initially, I thought they were these highly complex mathematical formulas that I would never understand. As it turns out, they are just step-by-step instructions that we write for the computer to interpret and execute. As simple as that sounds, the computer needs to be told very specifically what to do and how to do it, otherwise it might return an unexpected result.  

While I am still struggling to write algorithms that outputs the results correctly, I've come to realize that writing algorithms can have this artistic element to it. There are many ways to come to an answer and each person may approach the problem differently. There are a couple things I remind myself when I try to solve problems:  

1. Learn to pseudocode! - this is one thing I am still working on. Writing out good pseudocode and planning what you want to do before implementing is a good way to plan out your attack on the problem. It will also help you keep track of your thought process and ideas.  
2. There are many answers! - There are many ways to approach a problem. However, depending on the situation, you might need to consider time or space complexity for the solution.  
3. Practice makes perfect! - just like any skill, it takes a ton of practice and time to master a skill. Here are some sites where you can practice writing algorithms
