<p>Hey! Thanks for stopping by!</p>

<p>I'm a full stack software engineer that has a knack for being able to problem solve very efficiently. I enjoy deep diving and exploring new technologies. Recently, I built an iOS app that creates a layer of honesty for social media profiles using React Native, a new and exciting framework created by Facebook. I also enjoy building applications from the ground up and manipulating large data sets.</p>

<p>I'm also intrigued with different ways of thinking. I hope to include more links to interesting articles that I find. I also want this blog to help me become a better communicator.</p>

<p>Thanks! :)</p>
